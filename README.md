******* quest for global domination has prompted us to open a supermarket – we sell only three products:



|Product |code Name    |Price

|FR1      |Fruit tea         |£ 3.11

|SR1      |Strawberries   |£ 5.00

|CF1      |Coffee            |£11.23



Our CEO is a big fan of buy-one-get-one-free offers and of fruit tea. He wants us to add a rule to do this.
The COO, though, likes low prices and wants people buying strawberries to get a price 
discount for bulk purchases. If you buy 3 or more strawberries, the price should drop to £4.50.
Our check-out can scan items in any order, and because the CEO and COO change 
their minds often, it needs to be flexible regarding our pricing rules.
The interface to our checkout looks like this (shown in Ruby):


co = Checkout.new(pricing_rules)

co.scan(item)

co.scan(item)

Price = co.total

Implement a checkout system that fulfils these requirements in Ruby.
